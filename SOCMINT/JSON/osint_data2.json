When you do that, opportunities come your way. Fortunately we got the momentum we needed. Our batting line-up is in good form, barring myself. It is a unit that has been together for sometime. [On their bowling] We were watching the games that were played here. Obviously it was risky but the variable bounce assisted us. We kept mid-off and mid-on up, which made us predictable but we backed ourselves. We came into the tournament as non-favourites and we will keep flying under the radar. We will keep improving and that's what we are doing.\"\n\n**Lungi Ngidi is the player of the match**: \"[On the finish] It was very nerve-wracking. When games get so close, you cannot do much as a bowler but just sit. It is one of my biggest wins - to win an award at the World Cup. It comes down to watching a lot of games being played here. We have also played here earlier. We saw Pakistan bowl and it helped.

            "text": "In the aftermath of Asia Cup 2025 one thing is clear the chasm between India and rest of South Asia is quite wide. It is a bit concerning.  At one point cricket in South Asia was very competitive with India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka able to defeat each other without it being deemed an upset. Even Bangladesh with Shakib, Tamim, Mushfiq, Mustafizur and Mahmudullah was looking up !!\n\nHowever in last decade and specifically in last 5-6 years India has clearly pulled apart . In T-20Is these teams are still competitive as the format is such that any of them can beat India on its day.. But the gap is really wide in Test cricket and ODI cricket. I did a statistical analysis of this from 1 Jan 2016 onwards .\n\nStarting with Test cricket. I got numbers  for these 4 nations against opposition that included these 4 + Australia, England, South Africa, New Zealand and West Indies !\n\nHere is the W/L ratio\n\n[Test Cricket W\\/L ratio](https://preview.redd.it/f5832xottztf1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=d34d2c504a4261ca6dbbab67848dbcd740f7e1ad)\n\nThe gap is really big and the under lying reasons are obvious. India have obviously batted and bowled way more better\n\n[Batting & Bowling Averages and Differences](https://preview.redd.it/nyj7ztkmgwtf1.png?width=1421&format=png&auto=webp&s=329422680436fb4077c60c54f9c31773c9a93302)\n\nAs we can see India has the highest batting and lowest bowling average. Please note these averages include extras also !!\n\nNow India has been a traditional spin power house but since 2016 Indian pacers have simply done way better than their other South Asian counterparts in Test cricket:\n\n[Magic Quadrant for South Asian pacers \\(Teamwise\\)](https://preview.redd.it/b01syo10owtf1.png?width=1437&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c5a7d62796bc7caa60134975a011435de878b2c)\n\nAs the quadrant above represents Indian pacers have had superb average as well as terrific strike rate since 2016. An average of less than 27 and Strike rate of less than 50 is pretty good. Pakistan the traditional pace power house has in contrast has averaged close to 33 with a Strike rate of 60 + . Just to show the amount of regression for Pakistan \" Between 1st Jan 1990 and 31 Dec 1995 Pakistani pacers averaged 23.22 and struck at  every 49th ball -- this was for 43 tests or so ! This was when the 2Ws were simply outstanding !\n\nHowever the above graphic alone doesn't truly represent the impact of Indian pacers. Indian pacers have taken 35 5-wicket hauls in 99 tests in this period thus a fifer every 2.82 matches. Nobody else amongst Pak, SL and BD has lower than 3.5 tests per fifer .\n\nIndian spinners meanwhile have far superior numbers compared to their South Asian Peers and that is what really pushes India so far ahead !\n\n[Magic Quadrant for South Asian Spinners ](https://preview.redd.it/tnsw43fxqwtf1.png?width=1438&format=png&auto=webp&s=8165f2523f97c0af2d44a23f82d6bbe68f686750)\n\nIndian spinners have a simply been so far ahead in this period when it comes to both averages as well as strike rates ! Thanks to Ash and Jaddu primarily.\n\nComing to ODI cricket also India has simply been ahead of everyone else since 2016. Here is a summary of W/L ratios in ODIs since 2016 :\n\n[W\\/L Ratios in ODIs](https://preview.redd.it/dh4h5as1twtf1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0e8d36825ebd7bd3d5999d06756699f312855c2)\n\n\\*\\* For ODI analysis I have added Afghanistan, Ireland and Zimbabwe as opponents as well  \nHere are the bowling and batting average differences :\n\n[Batting, Bowling averages and Differences in ODIs](https://preview.redd.it/9kqfeb8dtwtf1.png?width=2003&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf88cbc75e08f13371bf01278559434aeb712e3b)\n\nIndia has massive difference of 13.59 .Pakistan is 2nd but really far away with a difference of only 2.2 !!\n\nODI is a batters game and Indian batters have massively outperformed Pakistani, Sri Lankan and Bangladeshi batters in the said period:\n\n[ODI Batting Averages vs Strike Rates](https://preview.redd.it/elu7f0e7wwtf1.png?width=1539&format=png&auto=webp&s=85a27b51363916c68e6eaf5fa212c03c9572676d)\n\nLook how far is India from Pakistan (top right hand quadrant).  Pakistani batting is much maligned but it clearly is miles ahead of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka and has infact been quite effective and quietly so .\n\nAnd while batting rules the roost in ODIs bowling is also quite vital . And here too India bowlers have done splendidly !\n\n[ODI Economy and Strike Rates](https://preview.redd.it/fwulxqy1ywtf1.png?width=1438&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3f196595baf00758f7e2ac7404d17e5c5f1f908)\n\nNote Indians have a Strike rate of less than 35 and economy rate of less than 5.3. Only Bangladesh have a marginally better Economy than Indians but they don't really take wickets at a fast enough clip as the graphic above shows.\n\nFurther more India's ODI Dominance is by and large a factor of their top 3 batters doing excellently.\n\nLook at the dominance of India's top 3 batters -- thanks Rohit, Dhawan, Kohli and Gill\n\n[Top 3 ODI averages and strike rates](https://preview.redd.it/81kyt7y80xtf1.png?width=1751&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c22e52fda23941da5174ab00ae9f42d043bd794)\n\nNobody except India's top 3 strikes at over 90 ! And to top it they score at an average of 54+. No one even averages even 50+ !  Again here Pakistani top 3 does  really well thanks to Fakhar, Imam and Babar.\n\nIndividually Indian batters and bowlers have dominated Test and ODI charts when compared to their South Asian counterparts since 2016.\n\nSome of these differences weren't as stark in the past . Let us look at ODI batting numbers between 1998 and 2012 when South Asia cricket was at its competitive best\n\n[ODI batting average and strike rates \\(1998-2012\\)](https://preview.redd.it/k7errn4q2xtf1.png?width=1751&format=png&auto=webp&s=6883e3cae700e9f5463f63ad051f8d2ad7ff566a)\n\nNote how India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan are in the top right hand quadrant. India seems to be pulling ahead with bat still but not by that much and that was balanced by bowlers !!\n\n[ODI bowling Economy and Strike rate \\(1998-2012\\). ](https://preview.redd.it/895aqkzj3xtf1.png?width=1438&format=png&auto=webp&s=72a1250c9852800b8cc9e1bd1d8fe5b6f41a2fca)\n\nThe best quadrant is the bottom left hand quadrant and both Pakistan and Sri Lanka are in it. This also shows that Pakistan was a terrific attacking bowling unit while Sri Lanka were really good at choking flow of runs and also getting wickets in that process. This bowling superiority of Pakistan and Sri Lanka offset the batting superiority of India to a great extent.  Pakistan had the best W/L ratio of 1.277 in this period whereas India was #2 at 1.248 while Sri Lanka was a close #3 at 1.187.\n\nAs an Indian fan while I really cherish India's dominance in last 10 years I also miss in a way the era of competitiveness that 1998-2012 was ! And I am sure Pakistani fans  would be missing the era of 1986-1997 when they were highly dominant particularly in ODI cricket !",

            "title": "WTC Final Qualification: Analysing Each Contender Through Their Scenarios (Last Series Updated: New Zealand vs South Africa)",
            "text": "This is the first of a series of threads exploring the scenarios for all the teams that are contending for a WTC Final spot. Apart from the scenarios, I‚Äôll also be giving my analysis on each team‚Äôs scenarios and what is the least that they should be aiming for to have a chance of qualifying for the Final.\n\nAs the last part of the title suggests, the plan is to make a new post after every 2-3 series where I update the scenarios and analysis for each contender. Shoutout to [u/JohnGrimShade](https://www.reddit.com/user/JohnGrimShade) and [u/Kingslayer1526](https://www.reddit.com/user/Kingslayer1526) for giving me the idea.\n\n# The Method:\n\nThis post is entirely based on the premise that in my opinion, it is impossible to qualify for the WTC Final with a PCT of less than 60% and similarly it is also impossible to miss out on qualification with a PCT of more than 70%.\n\nTherefore, I have stated the specific scenario that each contender needs in order to breach the baseline of 60% PCT and then the consequent improving scenarios that would lead up to said team eventually breaching the 70% PCT mark.\n\nThere is no magic number that guarantees qualification, but according to my estimation, 62%-65% PCT can be good enough to qualify for the Final but you would have to hope that a few other teams‚Äô results go in your favour. Anything above 65% PCT is fantastic and gives a good chance of qualifying for the Final without having to rely on other teams‚Äô results.\n\n# The Assumptions:\n\n1. Since 3 Draws = 1 Win and 2      Losses in terms of points, I have excluded scenarios of more than 2 Draws      throughout my post. If your team draws 3 or more Tests, just use the above      equation to convert them into wins and losses and refer to the scenarios      accordingly. For example, 7 draws would become 2 wins 4 losses and 1 draw\n2. I have also assumed that no      team is docked points for slow over-rate.\n\nI have erred on the side of caution and included even those teams that have an outside chance of making the Final. That is why we are covering a WHOPPING 6 contenders for the WTC Final: New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Australia, South Africa, India and Pakistan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# NEW ZEALAND\n\nCurrent PCT = 38.89%, No. of Tests Remaining = 7\n\nHome: 2 Tests vs Sri Lanka\n\nAway: 2 Tests in Pakistan, 3 Tests in England\n\nIn order to breach the 60% PCT mark, NZ need at least 5 wins and 2 draws. Here are the scenarios:\n\n5 Wins 2 Draws = 61.54% PCT\n\n6 Wins 1 Losses = 64.10% PCT\n\n6 Wins 1 Draw = 66.67% PCT\n\n7 Wins = 71.79% PCT\n\nMy analysis: New Zealand can afford a maximum of one loss from their remaining 7 Tests. The next best scenario: 5 wins and 2 draws may not be good enough as chances of qualifying for the Final with 61.54% PCT are pretty slim. With 6 wins from 7 Tests, NZ will finish with 64.1% PCT and take points away from direct rivals Sri Lanka and Pakistan thus decreasing both team‚Äôs chances of reaching 64.1% PCT. Then New Zealand will have to hope for only a few other teams‚Äô results to go their way in order to qualify with 64.1% PCT.\n\nBut of course, if New Zealand do better than 6 wins 1 losses from the 7 Tests, the reliance on other teams‚Äô results will lessen even further.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# SRI LANKA\n\nCurrent PCT = 100%, No. of Tests remaining = 10\n\nHome: 2 Tests vs Australia and 2 Tests vs Pakistan\n\nAway: 2 Tests in India, 2 Tests in Bangladesh and 2 Tests in New Zealand\n\nOut of the 10 Tests, Sri Lanka need at least 5 wins and 1 draw in order to breach the 60% PCT mark. Here are the scenarios:\n\n5 Wins 1 Draw 4 Losses = 61.11% PCT\n\n5 Wins 2 Draws 3 Losses = 63.89% PCT\n\n6 Wins 4 Losses = 66.67% PCT\n\n6 Wins 1 Draw 3 Losses = 69.44% PCT\n\n6 Wins 2 Draws 2 Losses= 72.22% PCT\n\nMy analysis: The obvious worry from a Sri Lanka point of view are the 4 away Tests in India and New Zealand. However, Sri Lanka can make the Final even if those 4 Tests end up in 4 Losses. In order for that to happen, Sri Lanka will have to win all 6 of their remaining Tests and finish with 66.67% PCT. In the scenario of 4 losses to India and New Zealand, winning all of the other 6 Tests becomes extremely crucial because even the next best scenario: 5 wins and 1 draw won‚Äôt be good enough as chances of qualification with 61.11% PCT are pretty slim. In this scenario, Sri Lanka won‚Äôt have to worry about other teams‚Äô results going their way as 66.67% PCT should be good enough for qualification every single time.\n\nIf Sri Lanka do manage to nick a draw from one of their away Tests in India and New Zealand, they can then afford to draw one of their other 6 Tests and finish with 63.89% PCT which can also be good enough for qualification. This scenario gives Sri Lanka a slight margin of error in the other 6 Tests but of course in this scenario, Sri Lanka finish on a lower PCT which would mean that the reliance on other teams‚Äô results will increase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# AUSTRALIA\n\nCurrent PCT = 86.66% PCT, No. of Tests remaining = 14\n\nHome: 3 Tests vs South Africa and 2 Tests vs West Indies\n\nAway: 3 Tests in Pakistan, 2 Tests in Sri Lanka, 4 Tests in India\n\nIn order to breach the 60% PCT mark, Australia need at least 7 Wins and 1 Draw. Here are the scenarios:\n\n7 Wins 1 Draw 6 Losses = 61.4% PCT\n\n7 Wins 2 Draws 5 Losses = 63.16% PCT\n\n8 Wins 6 Losses = 64.91% PCT\n\n8 Wins 1 Draw 5 Losses = 66.67% PCT\n\n8 Wins 2 Draws 4 Losses = 68.42% PCT\n\n9 Wins 5 Losses = 70.17% PCT\n\nMy analysis: The biggest worry from Australia‚Äôs point of view are the 4 Tests in India. Since those 4 Tests are the last ones that Australia play in the cycle, they need to get majority of the required points in the 10 Tests preceding it so that they enter the India series needing to do very little: getting a draw, 2 draws, a win or at maximum a win and a draw.\n\nAustralia need to get at least 63.16% as the chances of qualifying with 61.4% PCT are pretty slim. Australia need at least 6 wins 1 draw 3 losses from their other 10 Tests. If they get 6 wins 1 draw 3 losses, they would need a win and a draw in India to finish on 63.16% PCT. If Australia get 6 wins 2 draws 2 losses, then just one win will be needed in India. Getting 7 wins 3 losses would reduce the equation needed in India to 2 draws. Basically, Australia should try and get as many points as possible before the India Tests so that the reliance on getting points in India is as less as possible. Another thing to note is that 4 out of Australia‚Äôs remaining 5 series are against direct rivals. That‚Äôs why the points that Australia get from these series will be points taken away from direct rivals.\n\nOn 63.16% PCT Australia would need a few other teams‚Äô results to qualify for the Final. But of course, if Australia get more than 63.16% PCT, the reliance on other teams‚Äô results will lessen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# SOUTH AFRICA\n\nCurrent PCT = 60%, No. of Tests remaining = 10\n\nHome: 2 Tests vs Bangladesh and 2 Tests vs West Indies\n\nAway: 3 Tests in England and 3 Tests in Australia\n\nIn order to breach the 60% PCT mark, South Africa need at least 6 wins. Here are the scenarios:\n\n6 Wins 4 Losses = 60% PCT\n\n6 Wins 1 Draw 3 Losses = 62.22% PCT\n\n6 Wins 2 Draws 2 Losses = 64.44% PCT\n\n7 Wins 3 Losses = 66.67% PCT\n\n7 Wins 1 Draw 2 Losses = 68.89% PCT\n\n7 Wins 2 Draws 1 Loss = 71.11% PCT\n\nMy analysis: South Africa need to win all 4 Home Tests to make sure that they do not have too much to do in their 6 away Tests. If South Africa win all 4 Home Tests against Bangladesh and West Indies, they would need 2 wins and 1 draw from their 6 Tests in Australia and England in order to reach 62.22% PCT. South Africa need at least 62.22% PCT because chances of qualifying for the Final with the next best scenario of 60% PCT are extremely slim. Even 62.22% PCT is slightly on the lower side and South Africa would need quite a few other teams‚Äô results to go their way in order to qualify. 62.22% PCT gives them a chance but if South Africa win all 4 Home Tests and do better than 2 wins and 1 draw in their Away Tests and finish on a higher PCT, the reliance on other teams‚Äô results will lessen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# INDIA\n\nCurrent PCT = 49.07%, No. of Tests remaining = 9\n\nHome: 2 Tests vs Sri Lanka and 4 Tests vs Australia\n\nAway: 1 Test in England and 2 Tests in Bangladesh\n\nIn order to breach the 60% PCT mark, India need at least 6 wins and 2 draws. Here are the scenarios:\n\n6 Wins 2 Draws 1 Loss = 61.57% PCT\n\n7 Wins 2 Losses = 63.43% PCT\n\n7 Wins 1 Draw 1 Loss = 65.28% PCT\n\n7 Wins 2 Draws = 67.13% PCT\n\n8 Wins 1 Loss = 68.98% PCT\n\n8 Wins 1 Draw = 70.83% PCT\n\nMy analysis: India need to win all 4 Tests against Sri Lanka and Bangladesh otherwise they will have too much to do in their other 5 Tests which are more difficult. Apart from the four wins against Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, India need at least 3 wins from their remaining 5 Tests against Australia and England. Even the next best scenario: 6 wins 2 draws and 1 loss may not be good enough as the chances of qualification with 61.57% PCT are pretty slim.\n\nGetting all 4 wins against Sri Lanka and Bangladesh and then 3 wins 2 losses from the other 5 Tests would mean that India end up with 63.43% PCT and take points away from direct rivals Sri Lanka and Australia which lessens both those team‚Äôs chances of reaching India‚Äôs tally of 63.43% PCT. India would then need a few other teams‚Äô results to go their way in order to qualify with 63.43% PCT.\n\nBut of course, if India do better than 7 Wins 2 Losses and finish with a higher PCT, the reliance on other teams‚Äô results will lessen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# PAKISTAN\n\nCurrent PCT = 75%, No. of Tests Remaining = 10\n\nHome: 3 Tests vs Australia, 3 Tests vs England, 2 Tests vs New Zealand\n\nAway: 2 Tests in Sri Lanka\n\nIn order to breach the 60% PCT mark, Pakistan need at least 5 Wins and 2 Draws. Here are the scenarios:\n\n5 Wins 2 Draws 3 Losses = 61.9% PCT\n\n6 Wins 4 Losses = 64.29% PCT\n\n6 Wins 1 Draw 3 Losses = 66.67% PCT\n\n6 Wins 2 Draws 2 Losses = 69.05% PCT\n\n7 Wins 3 Losses = 71.43% PCT\n\nMy analysis: The equation for Pakistan is rather straightforward: Win at least 6 Tests out of their remaining 10 Tests. With 6 wins 4 losses, Pakistan would finish with 64.29% PCT and take points away from direct rivals Australia, New Zealand and Sri Lanka. Pakistan would need only a few other team's results to go their way in order to qualify with 64.29% PCT.\n\nBut of course, if Pakistan do better than 6 wins 4 losses from their 10 Tests, the reliance on other teams‚Äô results lessens even further.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis brings us to the end of the post. If there are any suggestions regarding improving the current structure of the post or just general feedback, I‚Äôd love to hear it. The next post will be released after the Pakistan vs Australia Test Series.",

That's how I see it,\" Markram said ahead of the team's departure on Monday. \" Ultimately, if it's going to be extreme like it was in the English series, then it's going to be difficult for both teams from a batting point of view. For us as a squad, we've just got to be happy with what we have, whatever the conditions look like and to back whoever it is on the day to get the job done. So I'm not too fussed by it.\"\n\nMarkram's reference to \"the English series,\" harks back to this time last year, when¬†[Pakistan hosted England](https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/england-in-pakistan-2024-25-1442205). After losing the first Test, Pakistan won the next two on pitches that turned square after using everything from¬†[industrial fans and heaters to windbreakers](https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/pakistan-deploy-fans-heaters-in-bid-to-produce-rawalpindi-turner-1456402)¬†to dry out the surfaces. Those games were played in Multan and Rawalpindi.¬†[South Africa will play in Lahore and Rawalpindi](https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/south-africa-in-pakistan-2025-26-1501888), where¬†[29 of 31 wickets in the England Test fell to spin](https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/england-in-pakistan-2024-25-1442205/pakistan-vs-england-3rd-test-1442217/full-scorecard).\"\n\nRecent reports suggest that the pitches are going to be spin friendly, and some Pakistan players undertook a red ball camp of their own a couple of weeks ago. Most of the footage of that red ball camp is spinners bowling to Babar Azam.",

            "text": "This is the 8th edition of my WTC Analysis post which explores the scenarios for all the teams that are contending for a WTC Final spot.\n\nJust like before, I‚Äôll be giving the scenarios and my analysis of each contender.\n\nAssumptions made in the post:\n\n1. Since 3 Draws = 1 Win and 2 Losses in terms of points, I have excluded scenarios of more than 2 Draws throughout my post. If your team draws 3 or more Tests, just use the above equation to convert them into wins and losses and refer to the scenarios accordingly. For example, 4 draws would become 1 Win 1 Draw and 2 Losses.\n2. I have assumed that no team is docked points for slow over-rate. If a points deduction does happen, it will be accounted for in the next edition of the post.\n3. Certain series results have been assumed to reduce the variables and narrow the scope of the analysis. The assumed series results are India winning both tests in Bangladesh and South Africa winning both tests at home vs West Indies. If these assumptions turn out to be wrong, it will be accounted for in the next edition of the post.\n4. According to my calculations, it is almost impossible to qualify for the WTC Final with less than 53.33% PCT. Thus, 53.33% PCT has been used as a baseline for teams to be in contention for qualification (except for Australia due to their unique circumstance). 62% PCT guarantees qualification with zero reliance on other teams' results.\n\nI have erred on the side of caution and included even those teams that have an outside chance of making the Final. That is why we are covering 5 contenders for the WTC Final: Pakistan, Sri Lanka, India, Australia and South Africa. But first we‚Äôll have a look at the other teams.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# THE NON-CONTENDERS\n\nBangladesh: Can finish on a maximum of 27.78% PCT with 2 wins from their 2 remaining Tests.\n\nEngland: Can finish on a maximum of 46.97% PCT with 1 win from their remaining Test.\n\nNew Zealand: Can finish on a maximum of 48.72% PCT with 4 wins from their 4 remaining Tests.\n\nWest Indies: Can finish on a maximum of 50% PCT with 2 wins from their 2 remaining Tests.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow for the 5 contenders‚Ä¶\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# PAKISTAN\n\nCurrent PCT = 42.42% PCT, No. of Tests remaining = 3\n\nHome: 1 Test vs England, 2 Tests vs New Zealand\n\nIn order to breach the 53.33% PCT mark, Pakistan need 3 Wins. Here are the scenarios:\n\n3 Wins = 54.76% PCT (Extremely High reliance on other teams) ^((1))\n\n(1) Pakistan will have to hope that: a) Australia whitewash South Africa at home and win 2-1 in India. b) Sri Lanka do not win their series in New Zealand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# SRI LANKA\n\nCurrent PCT = 53.33% PCT, No. of Tests remaining = 2\n\nAway: 2 Tests in New Zealand\n\nIn order to breach the 53.33% PCT mark, Sri Lanka need at least 1 Win and 1 Draw in New Zealand. Here are the scenarios:\n\n1 Win 1 Draw = 55.56% PCT (High reliance on other teams) ^((1))\n\n2 Wins = 61.11% PCT (Low reliance on other teams) ^((2))\n\n(1) Sri Lanka will have to hope that: a) Australia whitewash South Africa at home. b) Australia win 2-1 in India or the series ends in a 1-1 draw.\n\n(2) Sri Lanka will have to hope that only one of these 3 things happen: a) Australia getting 2 wins and 2 draws in their 7 remaining Tests. b) India winning by a margin of 3-1 or better vs Australia. c) South Africa getting a win and draw or more in Australia.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# INDIA\n\nCurrent PCT = 52.08%, No. of Tests remaining = 6\n\nHome: 4 Tests vs Australia\n\nAway: 2 Tests in Bangladesh\n\nIn order to breach the 53.33% PCT mark, India need at least 3 Wins and 2 Draws. Here are the scenarios:\n\n3 Wins 2 Draws = 55.09% PCT\n\n4 Wins = 56.94% PCT\n\n4 Wins 1 Draw = 58.8% PCT\n\n4 Wins 2 Draws = 60.65% PCT\n\n5 Wins = 62.5% PCT\n\n5 Wins 1 Draw = 64.35% PCT\n\n6 Wins = 68.06% PCT\n\n|**Scenario**|**PCT**|**Reliance on other teams**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|2 wins in Bangladesh and a 1-1 draw vs Australia|55.09% PCT|Extremely high reliance ^((1))|\n|2 wins in Bangladesh and a 2-2 draw vs Australia|56.94% PCT|High reliance ^((2))|\n|2 wins in Bangladesh and a 2-1 win vs Australia|58.8% PCT|Moderate reliance ^((3))|\n|2 wins in Bangladesh and a 2-0 win vs Australia|60.65% PCT|Low reliance ^((4))|\n|2 wins in Bangladesh and a 3-1 win vs Australia|62.5% PCT|Zero reliance|\n\n(1) India will have to hope that: a) Australia whitewash South Africa at home. b) Sri Lanka do not win their series in New Zealand.\n\n(2) India will have to hope that: a) Australia win against South Africa by a margin of 3-0 or 2-0. b) Sri Lanka do not win both tests in New Zealand.\n\n(3) India will have to hope that: a) Australia win against South Africa by a margin of 3-0, 2-0 or 1-0 or South Africa win the series by a margin of 1-0. b) Sri Lanka do not win both tests in New Zealand.\n\n(4) India will have to hope that: a) Sri Lanka do not win both tests in New Zealand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# SOUTH AFRICA\n\nCurrent PCT = 60.00%, No. of Tests remaining = 5\n\nHome: 2 Tests vs West Indies\n\nAway: 3 Tests in Australia\n\nIn order to breach the 53.33% PCT mark, South Africa need at least 2 wins.

Australia play all of their 7 remaining Tests against teams competing for a WTC Final spot which makes every Test they play a virtual \"six pointer\" to borrow a phrase from soccer. This has 2 implications:\n\n1. Australia's reliance on other teams is almost zero. Each scenario leads to guaranteed qualification or guaranteed elimination. In four scenarios, Australia will have to rely on Sri Lanka failing to win one of their remaining Tests but that's it.\n2. The second implication has been explained with the help of an example:\n\nScenario A: Australia win 2-0 vs South Africa and lose 0-4 in India.\n\nScenario B: Australia draw 1-1 vs South Africa and lose 1-3 in India.\n\nBoth scenarios would lead to Australia finishing on 59.65% PCT. But interestingly, Scenario A almost guarantees qualification for the Final whereas Scenario B guarantees elimination. This is because, in Scenario B, Australia lose considerable points to both South Africa and India allowing both of them to finish above Australia. On the other hand, in Scenario A, Australia finish above South Africa due to having denied a large number of points to them by beating them 2-0.\n\nAustralia's qualification chances for the WTC Final have been presented in the table below:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Table showing Australia's qualification chances for WTC Final for each scenario](https://preview.redd.it/s28yg85waf5a1.png?width=1680&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fc91f4736f6bc1d78682e13ba16927518dcf853)\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis brings me to the end of this edition of the post. If there are any suggestions regarding improving the current structure of the post or just general feedback, I‚Äôd love to hear it.",

            "text": "**Pakistan won the toss and decided to bat**\n\n\n**Pakistan** : 308/7 | H Sohail 89(59), B Azam 69(80) | L Ngidi 3/64, I Tahir 2/41\n\n**SA** : 259/9 | du Plessis 63(79), de Kock 47(60) | W Riaz 3/46, S Khan 3/50\n\n\n**Pakistan won by 49 runs**\n\n**MoTM Haris Sohail** : It was very difficult to sit out of the games but I knew I would get the opportunity and I was backing myself to do well. When I went in there, the plan was to build partnership with Babar. it was not easy but we did well.\n\n**Faf du Plessis** : We're not playing great cricket. Whole tournament we've been good with the ball, but today we gave them a really good start. Pulled it back in the middle, but giving them 300-plus was 20 too many.Not spin in particular. You need to have a good start with the bat. We're losing a quick wicket almost all the time and then as we're building partnerships we're losing wickets. That's just the nature of the tournament. Struggling with a bit of confidence in our batting line-up. And thats cost 30-40 runs. We have to try. We've put in the practice. We're working hard. But confidence in sport is an amazing thing. When you're playing well, the ball just falls for you. But at the moment, we're down and when you play aginast a quality team like Pakistan, they put you under pressure. Imran Tahir has been amazing. He's been exceptional. He's played with a lot of heart and he's led our bowling attack but there hasn't been enough guys like Imran standing up. For me the biggest downside is that we're not doing justice to ourselves as team. We are playing against great teams. We've seen how crazy it is. But we are letting ourselves down considering the skill that's in that dressing room.\n\n**Sarfaraz** : I think it's a complete team performance. Credit to the openers. They played really well. Then Babar took over. And Haris Sohail put in a great performance. We changed the combination in this game. Couple of games earlier, we went with other combination. That's the only thing. Sometimes change is good for the team. Today the way Haris batted, he is hungry to play in the game. He's the main factor, the turning point, the way he batted in the last 15 overs, it was like Jos Buttler. We have to work harder on fielding. Again we dropped so many catches today. All three matches now are very crucial and we have to sort it out.\n\n\n**SA become the second team after Afghanistan to be mathematically out of the semis** ([Points Table](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D9w6PdbW4AA7Jlm?format=jpg&name=medium))\n\n\n[Cricinfo](https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8039/scorecard/1144512/pakistan-vs-south-africa-30th-match-icc-cricket-world-cup-2019) | [Cricbuzz](https://www.cricbuzz.com/live-cricket-scores/20266/pak-vs-rsa-match-30-icc-cricket-world-cup-2019) | [Official Highlights (349 seconds)](https://www.cricketworldcup.com/video/1254584/cwc19-pak-v-sa-match-highlights)",

Tried my level best, but good thing was that we fought till the end...that was the good thing. I was talking to every guy at the crease that if you take 15-20 balls, the wicket is good. But it wasn't easy for newcomers. One side boundary was short, and that was my plan - to target it. I was just waiting for the message, looking for partnership, but that wasn't in our hands. When the run-rate was going over 11, I was just hitting. I was trying, but you know, it's a funny game. Good thing for us was we got close. I can't say if it's my best innings. I enjoyed it, but if we had won I would've said this is my best. But since we didn't, I can't say that.\"\n\n**Babar Azam** \"Fakhar's innings was one of the best I've seen. Fantastic, unfortunate he couldn't finish it. Till Fakhar was playing, I had hope. I think if he had a few other batsmen stood by with him, we would've won. Fakhar was doing all alone. The mistakes we have done, we will try to fix them next game.\"\n\n**Temba Bavuma** \"Super happy. That's what we came here to do - knew we had to win to stay in the series. The innings he played, probably the best I have come across. The bowlers were trying to be clear. Unfortunately, everything he was trying came off. Credit to him. There's an opportunity for us as a fielding team to dissect what happened in that period and what areas we can improve on. I was thinking about taking wickets when they were seven down, that's why we got Shamsi in, but got to give him credit when it's due. In terms of our batting, I felt batting was tough up front when I came in. In the morning, there is something for the bowlers. When I came in with Quinny, it was about building a partnership and inject some momentum. Allowed one of our first three batsmen play deep allowed Rassie and David to play their cameos. We'll be trying to clear our minds and rest our bodies before the final game. Two games with one day's rest isn't easy. Make sure when we come back for the next ODI, we want to cover our bases. There's that dynamic also, that our IPL boys are going to represent us there, so we'll have some discussions between the coach and the selectors. And hopefully the guys who come in are mentally ready to do it for the team.\"\n\n**Stat alert:** Highest % of team's tally in a completed ODI innings for Pakistan:\n\n**Stat alert:** Fakhar now has the highest individual ODI score by a visiting player in South Africa. Previous: 173 by David Warner in 2016.\n\n\n\n[^(Send feedback)](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=poochi&subject=Bot Feedback) ^| [^(Schedule)](https://np.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/bot_schedule) ^| [^(Stat Help)](https://np.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/bot_help)\n\n^(Please don't post illegal streaming links in match threads)",

            "text": "Hello, to all the cricket fans on this sub. Every time a world cup rolls around, the first thing that broadcasters start hyping is India vs Pakistan clash. 'Clash of Titans', 'Mauka Mauka' etc, this one cricket match has been providing for broadcasters', ICC's and the cricket board's revenues for a while now. \n\nBut, the story is more or less similar everything, the hype reaches fever pitch, the match happens, India beats Pakistan, analysts have a field day, Indians make fun of Pakistan on social media, Pakistani ex cricketers get some limelight and the caravan moves on to the next ICC tournament. Barring some matches notably the 2017 CT final and the 2021 T20 World cup match, this has more or less been the script.\n\nNow my question is, is it really even a rivalry? I did some analysis, I put together head to hear record of India, against other test playing nations. The attached image shows the summary. The data is of the last 10 years, i.e. 2014 - present and does not include tests, because India and Pakistan have not played a test match since 2007. If you look at the data, India have registered a win % of more than 70% across T20 and ODI, against Pakistan over the last 10 years. This is not good enough to classify as rivalry, this is mostly minnow bashing, with Pakistan registering a few big upsets in the middle. And the data does not account for ties/nr games. So India have a win% of 72% against Pakistan for e.g. does not mean, Pakistan has won the other 28%, nope that 28% also includes washed out and no result games.\n\nHow is this a rivalry if India is bashing them to an extent where only Sri Lanka and Bangladesh fare worse. Pakistan's wins should be considered as more of an upset if anything else, big upsets but upsets none the less.\n\nIf anything rivalry is what India has with Australia or England or New Zealand where the scales are almost at 50% win ratio in T20s and ODIs. Pakistan, the forever minnow Bangladesh and the struggling since 2011 Sri Lanka are statistically not comparable to India. Least of all Pakistan.\n\nLet's celebrate and legitimize actual rivalries, India vs Aus or India vs Eng. Atleast they will be more fun, with a lot more balance",

It's a great occasion and fantastic to get a win like that. It was important that we kept them playing [as often as possible]. We created pressure from both ends for a long period and I was the one that got the rewards. I'm pretty pleased with how we went. Speed is something I've been working on for a while and it just seems to be when I get my rhythm right I operate best. It was good fun [with the bat] to take it as deep as we could and put them under the pump. I think that was my first time batting [No.] 11 and I don't mind it. It's a great feeling to get this first Test win.\"\n\n**Tom Latham**: \"Its a fantastic performance. Winning the toss was a big part of it. It's probably the perfect performance. We are used to these conditions. We put their bowlers under pressure and scored at 4 an over. And we kept putting partnerships together. Matt Henry hasn't played a lot of Test cricket [but he] put the ball in the same area for long periods to get the results. We know how good South Africa are. We expect them to be at their best next game. Our focus is coming out and winning the next Test match.\"\n\n**Dean Elgar**: \"A lot went wrong. Not a lot went right. A bit of a self-reflection may not be a bad idea. We have some unplanned days off to do that. We should be a hell of a lot more competitive.\"\n\n**Tim Southee**: \"We knew we had a lot of work in front of us, and it was just a clinical three days from us. It was the way we wanted to play, and the way we've played in New Zealand for a while. When you play for long enough, you can tick off a few milestones along the way, but each time you're in the same conversation with Sir Richard is a special moment [Southee is now New Zealand's leading wicket-taker in home Tests]. It's a special victory, it's a side we haven't had a lot of success against. We know they'll bounce back, but we'll enjoy what has been a pretty impressive performance from everyone.\"\n\n\n\n[^(Send feedback)](https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=poochi&subject=Bot Feedback) ^| [^(Schedule)](https://np.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/bot_schedule) ^| [^(Stat Help)](https://np.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/bot_help)\n\n^(Please don't post illegal streaming links in match threads)",

            "text": "This is the 6th edition of my WTC Analysis post which explores the scenarios for all the teams that are contending for a WTC Final spot.\n\nJust like before, I‚Äôll be giving the scenarios and my analysis of each contender. If you‚Äôre curious about the assumptions made in this post, you can refer to a [previous edition](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/tnmd9q/wtc_final_qualification_analysing_each_contender/) where I explain everything in detail.\n\nI have erred on the side of caution and included even those teams that have an outside chance of making the Final. That is why we are covering 4 contenders for the WTC Final: Pakistan, India, Australia and South Africa. But first we‚Äôll have a look at the other teams.\n\n# THE NON-CONTENDERS\n\nBangladesh: Can finish on a maximum of 27.78% PCT with 2 wins from their 2 remaining Tests.\n\nNew Zealand: Can finish on a maximum of 48.72% PCT with 4 wins from their 4 remaining Tests.\n\nEngland: Can finish on a maximum of 51.52% PCT with 6 wins from their 6 remaining Tests.\n\nSri Lanka: While Sri Lanka are not eliminated yet, they need to win both of their remaining Tests in New Zealand in order to breach the 60% PCT mark and finish on 61.11% PCT. Even then Sri Lanka would be heavily reliant on other teams‚Äô results going their way in order to qualify for the Final.\n\nWest Indies: While West Indies are not eliminated yet, they would need at least 3 wins and 1 draw from their remaining 4 Tests in South Africa and Australia in order to barely breach the 60% PCT mark and finish on 60.26% PCT. Even then West Indies would be heavily reliant on other teams‚Äô results going their way in order to qualify for the Final.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow for the 4 contenders‚Ä¶\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# PAKISTAN\n\nCurrent PCT = 51.85%, No. of Tests Remaining = 5\n\nHome: 3 Tests vs England, 2 Tests vs New Zealand\n\nIn order to breach the 60% PCT mark, Pakistan need at least 4 Wins. Here are the scenarios:\n\n4 Wins 1 Loss = 61.9% PCT\n\n4 Wins 1 Draw = 64.29% PCT\n\n5 Wins = 69.05% PCT\n\nMy analysis: Pakistan need at least 4 wins from their 5 remaining Home Tests. With 4 wins and 1 loss, Pakistan would finish on 61.9% PCT. However, 61.9% PCT is on the lower side due to which Pakistan would be heavily reliant on other teams‚Äô results going their way. In order to qualify for the Final with less reliance on other teams‚Äô results, Pakistan need 4 wins and 1 draw from their remaining 5 Tests and finish on 64.29% PCT.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|**Scenario**|**PCT**|**Reliance on other teams**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|2-1 win vs England and 2-0 win vs New Zealand|61.9% PCT|High reliance|\n|3-0 win vs England and 1-1 draw vs New Zealand|61.9% PCT|High reliance|\n|2-0 win vs England and 2-0 win vs New Zealand|64.29% PCT|Low reliance|\n|3-0 win vs England and 1-0 win vs New Zealand|64.29% PCT|Low reliance|\n|3-0 win vs England and 2-0 win vs New Zealand|69.05% PCT|No reliance|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# INDIA\n\nCurrent PCT = 52.08%, No. of Tests remaining = 6\n\nHome: 4 Tests vs Australia\n\nAway: 2 Tests in Bangladesh\n\nIn order to breach the 60% PCT mark, India need at least 4 wins and 2 draws. Here are the scenarios:\n\n4 Wins 2 Draws = 60.65% PCT\n\n5 Wins 1 Losses = 62.5% PCT\n\n5 Wins 1 Draw = 64.35% PCT\n\n6 Wins = 68.06% PCT\n\nMy analysis: India can afford a maximum of one loss from their remaining 6 Tests. By getting 5 wins 1 loss from their remaining 6 Tests, India will finish on 62.5% PCT. However, 62.5% PCT is on the lower side due to which India would be heavily reliant on other teams‚Äô results going their way. The better India do, the reliance on other teams' results lessens.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|**Scenario**|**PCT**|**Reliance on other teams**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|2 wins in Bangladesh and a 3-1 win vs Australia|62.5% PCT|High reliance|\n|2 wins in Bangladesh and a 3-0 win vs Australia|64.35% PCT|Low reliance|\n|2 wins in Bangladesh and a 4-0 win vs Australia|68.06% PCT|No reliance|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# AUSTRALIA\n\nCurrent PCT = 70.00% PCT, No. of Tests remaining = 9\n\nHome: 3 Tests vs South Africa and 2 Tests vs West Indies\n\nAway: 4 Tests in India\n\nIn order to breach the 60% PCT mark, Australia need at least 3 Wins and 2 Draws. Here are the scenarios:\n\n4 Wins 2 Draws 3 Losses = 61.4% PCT\n\n5 Wins 4 Losses = 63.16% PCT\n\n5 Wins 1 Draw 3 Losses = 64.91% PCT\n\n5 Wins 2 Draws 2 Losses = 66.67% PCT\n\n6 Wins 3 Losses = 68.42% PCT\n\n6 Wins 1 Draw 2 Losses = 70.17% PCT\n\nMy analysis: The biggest worry from Australia‚Äôs point of view are the 4 Tests in India. Since those 4 Tests are the last ones that Australia play in the cycle, Australia would ideally want to get the majority of the required points in the 5 Home Tests preceding it so that they enter the India series needing to do as less as possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|**IF**|**THEN**|\n|:-|:-|\n|2 Home wins against West Indies and a 2-0 win against South Africa|A draw needed in India|\n|2 Home wins against West Indies and a 2-1 win against South Africa|2 draws needed in India|\n|2 Home wins against West Indies and a 1-0 win against South Africa|A win needed in India|\n|2 Home wins against West Indies and a 1-1 draw against South Africa|A win and a draw needed in India|\n|2 Home wins against West Indies and a 1-2 defeat against South Africa|A win and 2 draws needed in India|\n|2 Home wins against West Indies and a 0-1 defeat against   South Africa|2 wins needed in India|\n\nFulfilling any of the scenarios mentioned in the table would mean that Australia finish on 61.4% PCT. However, 61.4% PCT is on the lower side due to which Australia would be heavily reliant on other teams‚Äô results going their way. Australia need one more draw than the scenarios mentioned in the table and finish on 63.16% PCT in order to qualify for the Final with less reliance on other teams‚Äô results.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# SOUTH AFRICA\n\nCurrent PCT = 71.43%, No. of Tests remaining = 8\n\nHome: 2 Tests vs West Indies\n\nAway: 3 Tests in England and 3 Tests in Australia\n\nIn order to breach the 60% PCT mark, South Africa need at least 4 wins. Here are the scenarios:\n\n4 Wins 4 Losses = 60% PCT\n\n4 Wins 1 Draw 3 Losses = 62.22% PCT\n\n4 Wins 2 Draws 2 Losses = 64.44% PCT\n\n5 Wins 3 Losses = 66.67% PCT\n\n5 Wins 1 Draw 2 Losses = 68.89% PCT\n\n5 Wins 2 Draws 1 Loss = 71.11% PCT\n\nMy analysis: South Africa need to win both Home Tests against West Indies otherwise they will have too much to do in their 6 away Tests. Apart from the 2 Home wins against West Indies,\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|**IF**|**THEN**|\n|:-|:-|\n|0-3 loss in England and 2 Home wins against West Indies|2 wins and a draw needed in Australia|\n|0-2 loss in England and 2 Home wins against West Indies|2 wins needed in Australia|\n|0-1 loss in England and 2 Home wins against West Indies|A win and 2 draws needed in Australia|\n|1-2 loss in England and 2 Home wins against West Indies|A win and a draw needed in Australia|\n|1-1 draw in England and 2 Home wins against West Indies|A win needed in Australia|\n|1-0 win in England and 2 Home wins against West Indies|2 draws needed in Australia|\n|2-1 win in England and 2 Home wins against West Indies|A draw needed in Australia|\n|2-0 win in England and 2 Home wins against West Indies|No points needed in Australia|\n\nFulfilling any of the scenarios mentioned in the table would mean that South Africa finish on 62.22% PCT. However, 62.22% PCT is on the lower side due to which South Africa would be heavily reliant on other teams‚Äô results going their way. South Africa need one more draw than the scenarios mentioned in the table and finish on 64.44% PCT in order to qualify for the Final with less reliance on other teams‚Äô results.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis brings me to the end of this edition of the post.

Pakistan‚Äôs Salman Ali Agha, who‚Äôs been a T20 maestro since January 2025: **511 runs in 26 matches**, including four half-centuries, at a strike rate that makes a caffeinated hummingbird look lethargic (**114.57**). South Africa‚Äôs absence of David Miller (-150 odds implied probability: 60% for *nothing*), Aiden Markram, and Keshav Maharaj? That‚Äôs like asking a band to play a concert without its lead singer, drummer, and guitarist. You‚Äôll get noise, not music.\n\n---\n\n**News Digest: Injuries, Rest, and the ‚ÄúAlmost There‚Äù Mentality**  \nPakistan‚Äôs squad is a *full-strength fiesta*: Babar Azam (back from injury) is the headline act, flanked by Shaheen Afridi‚Äôs zippy fast bowling and Naseem Shah‚Äôs yorker-based taunts. Usman Khan‚Äôs gloves are steady as a rock (metaphorically‚Äîlet‚Äôs not test this in a real storm). South Africa? They‚Äôre fielding a team that reads like a ‚ÄúMost Likely to Win a Cricket Summer Camp‚Äù award. Quinton de Kock (keeper) and Lungi Ngidi are the A-listers, but where‚Äôs the glue? David Miller‚Äôs injury (a real loss, like losing your favorite spoon from a salad bar) and the rest of the big names mean this squad is more ‚ÄúNBA\n\nTo Be Continued...(full article) [https://www.gptsportswriter.com/prediction-detail/prediction-south-africa-vs-pakistan-2025-10-28/](https://www.gptsportswriter.com/prediction-detail/prediction-south-africa-vs-pakistan-2025-10-28/)",

I am not saying add a test match to every series but surely you can come up with some sort of agreement with the boards of SA and NZ to add a 3rd test?\n\nQuestion is, why has PCB completely stopped caring about Tests? There doesnt seem to be any plan. Like if there was no WTC, I could see PCB scrapping all tests just to keep playing non stop T20Is.\n\nA country with a history as Pakistan, we should not be playing 2 match test series at all.
