            "text": "The closeness of the final was a testament to how capable and talented Pakistani players are and can be. We had a brilliant start in our batting innings and an even better one in our bowling but we just bottled it.\n\nImagine if there was significantly less corruption and our cricket board was an actual meritocracy, as it should be. We would be a force to be reckoned with, if not unstoppable. And this is not me insulting anyone else's intelligence or coping. I genuinely believe this with all my heart and mind. \n\nBut instead, we have players in the team that have no business being there anymore and some who should've never got in it in the first place. An extreme example highlighting this  is Azam Khan getting international caps in the 2020s, come on now that's just a disgrace. \n\nMoving forward, the following changes I believe are a no brainer!  Fakhar, Rana Ashraf and Agha's position in the T20I squad have to be seriously reevaluated. Even if we had won the final and they had played an important role, I'd still be gung-ho on this opinion. \n\nWhat do you guys think? Would love to hear your thoughts! ",

            "text": "It‚Äôs been a while since the crazy Asia cup and everything has calmed down whilst the sub is up and running again. I did do a review but it got lost when the sub got locked which is fine. I won‚Äôt react on what happened at the Asia cup much but I will discuss what should happen now and what I think will happen. \n\nI‚Äôm going to start off with the captain. Let me get this straight, He wasn‚Äôt a bad captain but he wasn‚Äôt a great captain. He was alright but his own performance was crap. I even stated that I want him out even if we win the cup. I don‚Äôt want to sound bad and i definitely would‚Äôve loved to win the Asia cup but a part of me isn‚Äôt mad that we lost because it would‚Äôve covered up some of the cracks. The problem in Pakistan cricket is that if we win we ignore the bad things and if we lose we change everything and that isn‚Äôt the way. \n\nDon‚Äôt get me wrong this team is heading into the right direction but it does need some small changes to help them grow and get better. This includes getting rid of a batsman who strikes at 110 through 100 games and managed a 75 SR in the whole Asia cup and no he ain‚Äôt a mix of Imran Khan, MS Dhoni and Ricky Ponting for us to keep him as a specialist captain. To the people who disagree with me that‚Äôs fine but give me one reason he gets into the T20 team and don‚Äôt say captain because we all know that is dumb. I‚Äôm not even hating on the guy i‚Äôm just providing my reasoning based on his whole career. Even in the PSL when he led, ISLU lost all their momentum. Speaking about Shadab he put a Imran Khan post up and that only means one thingüò≠ bye bye to your spot for a bit. Jokes Ik he is injured but i wonder if anything will happen to him for the comment . And for anyone saying i‚Äôm being silly just remember PCB will wish guys who played one game Happy birthday but can‚Äôt mention our WC winning captain. \n\nAlso another reason i want Agha gone is because we actually need a proper middle order and not a plethora of anchors and all rounders. This means i want to see Imran Khan Niazi, Samad and Haider Ali if and when he returns to cricket. Swear bro got cleared. \n\nOnto the bowling now. It‚Äôs our strength and reason to be happy and watch games but it isn‚Äôt all perfect. Shaheen is slowly coming back and getting better. Bro it‚Äôs just bowing full and he is getting his pace back. Still needs his action fixed but i don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs ever happening. Abrar and Muqeem need to be our two specialist spinners until they perform bad or someone knocks the door down. Wasim Jr and Abbas Afridi need to be in and around the team as they are our two best pacers in the middle and death. Abbas actually has good stats for Pakistan with the ball but he isn‚Äôt consistently played which is annoying and both can definitely bat. Rauf needs to be dropped and i don‚Äôt mean forever but we all know in big matches and big moments he goes missing. This isn‚Äôt a one time thing. When has he won us a game in a tournament, whereas i can name three times when he choked and one was against USA. We all like to mention our poor batting but giving 15 off 6 against USA is very poor. Let him play this red ball comp and figure out a consistent line and length and make sure he doesn‚Äôt play the next series. Make him work back into the squad otherwise we will get same results in the T20 WC. Idk about you guys but he ain‚Äôt the best in Asia so he better not be a shoo in for the Wc either. \nAbbas Afridi will be lethal in those conditions imo as he likes to bowl slower balls which will get stuck in the pitch in SL and might get him a load of wickets. \n\nOur bowling lineup should look something like this:\n\nShaheen\n\nAbbas\n\nWasim Jr\n\nRauf\n\nAbrar\n\nMuqeem\n\nand that‚Äôs without our bucket load of all rounders. They are all lethal and are our best 6. Let Hasan Ali play red ball and Salman Mirza and Daniyal can play more domestic where they can show more consistency before they overtake one of the guys I have mentioned. \n\nOnto the batting which was a crap show. I genuinely don‚Äôt know what i was watching half the time. Yes we are bad at batting but I didn‚Äôt think we were that bad. When RizBar were first dropped i was skeptical but at the same time i wanted to see it because some of these boys will play for Pakistan for the next 10-15 years. I also wanted Rizwan dropped anyways as he actually was batting slower the ever whilst Babar actually improved even in his bad form. \n\nFirst series against NZ was a fail but it was a good learning curve. It gave us answers and showed us promise. After that the showing was getting better but the one constant was that when the pitch was difficult we showed no fight and got completely smacked. No growth was shown there. Coming to the Asia cup it didn‚Äôt go well and the stats showed that. Was very good though as they were tested in a tournament and they got a taste of the action before the World cup. \n\nSome players got dropped, some failed and one kind‚Äôve succeeded. I‚Äôm saying Kind‚Äôve because Farhans stats weren‚Äôt exceptional but they were better than the rest. It showed with the bat that we can remove RizBar but at this very moment we don‚Äôt have a complete lineup of batters that are better than both which is sad imo because Rizwan had a SR of 121. \n\nNow listen to me carefully I don‚Äôt want Rizwan back and i‚Äôd pick Haris failing everyday over him striking at 120 and stinking it up. Rizwan has never showed himself improving in the format strike rate wise and that annoyed me. But here it comes i genuinely think Babar could walk back in the team and that‚Äôs sad because the stats i‚Äôm going to show to back my ‚Äúopinion‚Äù show even in his very bad form he had a higher strike rate than some of these guys. I had people saying you can‚Äôt compare Agha to Babar because of the batting position and Agha is selfless but i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs selfless. I‚Äôll tell you why. He puts himself in the middle to lower middle order whilst we have batsman struggling ahead of him and then when he comes during a collapse or even at a good time he plays slow and gets out playing a dumb shot or he survives and plays a match losing innings of 19 off 23. It‚Äôs not selfless because he is taking a spot off a guy who can play in the middle and can actually hit. If someone said to me Babar can happily return but he has to bat at 5 or 6 i‚Äôd say i‚Äôd rather he retire and never don the green jersey again before he ever bats that low in a T20. \n\nAnyways stats time and feel free to look these up because i can be wrong but hopefully these websites don‚Äôt mess me up üò≠ For Babar i Will show stats since 2023 because he ain‚Äôt played a T20 International this year if im not wrong and for others ill show for both 2023 and 2025. \n\nBabar Azam: Avg 34.72 SR 134.99\n\nFakhar Zaman: Avg 27.75 SR 134.70 In 2025 Avg 29.13 SR 124.50 \n\nFarhan: Avg 23.12 SR 128.77 In 2025 Avg 28.27 SR 131.52 \n\nSaim: Avg 19.38 SR 134.11 in 2025 Avg 16.90 SR 129.09\n\nHasan Nawaz: Avg 22.45 SR 158.09 (Bro has the highest SR but got dropped for an anchor) \n\nAgha: Avg 23.37 SR 110.21 in 2025 Avg 26.89 SR 114.57\n\nHaris: Avg 16.70 SR 135.84 in 2025 Avg 18.65 SR 139.28 (Bro plays everywhere) \n\nRizwan: Avg 43.27 SR 121.33 \n\nThis clearly shows that a very poor and out of form Babar still managed a higher SR than most of the boys playing and a reason why i think he still could fit in the team. Someone might say but we are going to SL he can‚Äôt play spin but neither can the boys already in the squad because in the Tri series and Asia cup they faltered or they just can‚Äôt play spin when it‚Äôs actually spinning. \n\nIf i was to make a team now it would look like this based on stats and ability. It ain‚Äôt perfect but it‚Äôs what we have. \n\nFarhan\n\nBabar\n\nHaris (I need a wicketkeeper who doesn‚Äôt strike at 120 and Haris needs a long run at 3. I love Saim and his bowing is very good but i need bro to make runs so for a series maybe drop him but dw he is in my 15 and he most definitely should‚Äôve starting at the WC unless he still can‚Äôt bat. \n\nHassan (Best t20 player atm in the side. Batting wise. Only 3rd Pakistani in history with a 140 SR üò≠\n\nNiazi (give him a run) \n\nSamad (same thing as Niazi)\n\nShadab (floater and yes it depends on form and fitness otherwise Nawaz i guess) \n\nFaheem (I rate you now and you earnt your spot. Another spin all rounder can play here if needed but we will most likely have Saim as the third spin option. \n\nShaheen\n\nAbbas/Wasim Jr (whoever earns it. Abbas could be great in SL but Wasim is our best death bowler. could play both but they won‚Äôt. Wasim, Abbas and Shaheen can bat so you won‚Äôt need Faheem for cover. \n\nAbrar\n\n\nThat‚Äôs my team for SL and i think they could do very well if they are in form. Shadab for captain otherwise Shaheen. \n\nThey won‚Äôt do that tho. They will instead pick Rauf. Bring back RizBar and i‚Äôll be against that. Not pick Abbas and keep Wasim on the bench. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "text": "I wanted to speak about what i want to happen after the Asia cup and what i think will happen. I‚Äôm going early on this because i don‚Äôt want people to think im hating or anything and us winning the next 2 games or going out later today won‚Äôt change anything for me. Ik even if we lose tmrw or win the final the takes on the sub will be horrendous. If we lose then we will want another reset, Btw none of you better want hesson gone because we need a foreign coach who has no biases and he has put us toward the right direction. If we win then this team will become the best t20 team we had since 2009 for some of you. Quick question for you lot, If the 2021-22 T20 team played this one who would win. Imo 2021-22 wins on any pitch including flat ones. And Saifu t20 teams were better and i‚Äôm saying this even if we win which InshAllah happens. \n\nAgha the captain: I remember when he was made captain, I was wary due to his 100 plus games in domestic and his small amount of t20 games. Bro was striking below 120. It didn‚Äôt make sense that we were trying to evolve whilst making someone like him captain. First i thought he might be a yes man due to Naqvi and Aqib but i don‚Äôt have any reasonable evidence for that yet. Since then he has surprised me in some games but i always said his captaincy was worse than Babar‚Äôs and that‚Äôs saying something. In the last few series and this Asia Cup he has crapped the bed. For him these conditions were perfect but he still failed. He doesn‚Äôt have the inexperienced excuse either. Ik some people will say the others had 4 tournaments but they earnt it. For example RizBar first opened together in Feb 2021 if i‚Äôm not mistaken and they fired together in the t20 WC later that year. That team was relatively inexperienced aswell with young pacers but Malik and Hafeez added their experience. \n\nI think he will be backed to the 26 WC and that‚Äôs not the end of the world but they want batting conditions and they won‚Äôt get them there either. I think regardless of result, He shouldn‚Äôt captain after this and if you disagree that completely fine. Isn‚Äôt leading from the front, doesn‚Äôt inspire anyone or us and isn‚Äôt a tactical leader either. He might be selfless but him striking at 111 after 28 innings good enough. It‚Äôs not even average or below average. It‚Äôs just very bad. We can‚Äôt just hide him we ain‚Äôt a charity. In the middle order we need the likes of Niazi, Samad and Haider if he is completely cleared to play. Them 3 need a long rope so we finally have acc middle order batsman. Not one or two series they need 20-30 games. For example Irfan Khan Niazi strikes at 135 after 11 games. That is much better than Agha. \n\nI love Agha in the longer formats, he has surprised me and he has been one of our better players but he can‚Äôt play t20s. You can‚Äôt say RizBar are slow and bad then play 2-3 guys who bat even slower than them. Just doesn‚Äôt make sense. \n\nHave a young batting lineup like\n\nHaris\n\nFarhan\n\nSaim\n\nHassan\n\nNiazi\n\nHaider\n\nSamad\n\nShadab\n\nIf you want to play the modern way and evolve then do it fully otherwise what‚Äôs the point. \n\nFakhar Bhai same thing i love you in Odis but honestly Babar and Rizzy had more performances in this format and i don‚Äôt want to hear he didn‚Äôt open because he had mediocre stats there aswell. Even still i think bro might go off and win us this cup but it‚Äôs time to go i think. WC is in SL so conditions are spin friendly and similar to these. If he wins us this Asia Cup then yh by all means be an option for the WC but we can‚Äôt just have you there starting every game just in case you make runs. At that point bring Babar. We waiting for the same thing from aswell. \n\nI think if Fakhar continues poorly then he will walk himself as he is that kind of person but i don‚Äôt see a need of that because the team will continue to back him but i think he has enough time. \n\nBowlers we need to back the best available. Shaheen, Haris, Wasim Jr, Abbas Afridi (really good stats),Abrar and Muqeem. \n\nWe have all rounders but those are the best 6 available imo. Abbas and Wasim Jr Need to be backed. Through the middle and end they are wicket taking options and i‚Äôd even say both are better then Shaheen at the end. Ik Mirza and Daniyal had a good series in Bangladesh but they ain‚Äôt ready yet imo. \n\nWe need to play to our strengths instead of trying to copy other teams. Playing all these all rounders ain‚Äôt helping us bat or bowl better imo. Ik we want to play the modern way but if we don‚Äôt have the right players then we can make our own changes somewhere. InshAllah we have proper all rounders and middle order coming through that would answer all our questions. We have Hasan Nawaz but the management ain‚Äôt backing him. \n\nThere will be people saying Haris and Saim are also not performing but they need to be backed properly for longer. They have a lot of talent. With the stats and data shown we all know both need to be in the top 3 and Saim can‚Äôt bat in the first over so that means \n\nFarhan\n\nHaris\n\nSaim\n\ntop 3. Farhan ain‚Äôt had the best form and bro can‚Äôt rotate the strike which is crazy for such an experienced domestic performer. Last 2 matches have given him extra time because if he didn‚Äôt perform then people would‚Äôve got him out the team. ",

Jitesh should be in. Samson clearly has been struggling against spin in the middle overs. Jitesh is a better middle order finisher.\n\nDube with the bat has been sub standard for quite a while now. He is not justifying the All Rounder tag. If you want a part time 6th bowling option, you already have quite a few in the lineup.\n\nAnd if you are keeping Dube for his bowling and when in every match atleast 1-2 of your batters don't even get to bat, THEN JUST PLAY ARSHDEEP FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!\n\nThe guy is the leading T20I bowler. At this point not playing him almost seems like there's a definite GG agenda against him.\n\nSome of the decision making in this Asia Cup has been painful to watch. I have a few more but I'll leave that for later",

Yet, India's willingness to play Pakistan in multilateral events while refusing bilateral tours, reflects a double standard\n\nThis is prioritizing commercial interests (e.g., viewership and revenue from India-Pakistan matches) over a principled stance, unlike the South Africa boycott\n\nplaying cricket with Pakistan, even in neutral venues, sends a message of normalcy in bilateral relations despite ongoing conflicts. India should adopt a blanket boycott, as it did with South Africa, to signal zero tolerance for Pakistan's hostility\n\nIf BCCI is private entity, why it doesn't plays bilateral? If government has some control over it, then Narendra Modi & Amit Shah should be questioned for allowing this Asia Cup Participation\n\nSeveral countries actively boycott each other in sporting events due to political, ideological, border-related, or human rights issues: Iran - Israel Russia - Ukraine Arab Countries -Israel",

Justice Merchant should be dropped since he has been way too inconsistent and it is not just because of Gill as the pattern was there even before. That would make Jitesh the first choice keeper with Jurel, who was in reserves, as backup.\n\nAgarkar also mentioned that Sanju only played because Yashasvi and Shubman were not available. So I am guessing Yashasvi could make a comeback as Sanju is out and also be the extra batter instead of Rinku. Whether he actually plays is another question but he might be in the 15 man squad. ",

India's chase wasn't easy either, losing 3 wickets for just 20 runs before Tilak Varma (69* off 53 balls) and Shivam Dube pulled off a clutch partnership.\n\nWith 10 runs needed off the last over, Varma smashed a six that basically sealed India's 9th Asia Cup title! The crowd went absolutely wild.\n\nModi's \"Operation Sindoor\" reference is clearly a strategic dig at Pakistan, playing on recent tensions while celebrating the cricket victory. The timing of this post - just minutes after the match ended at 12:49 AM - shows how closely he was following the action.\n\nThis was India's third consecutive win over Pakistan in this tournament, maintaining their dominance in the rivalry. What a way to cap off an incredible Asia Cup campaign!\n\nWhat did you think of Modi's tweet? Too savage or just the right amount of celebration? üáÆüá≥",

The relations between both the countries have been really tense. It has not been much longer since then, and we have lost both our innocent civilians as well as the army personnel of our country, who have always been sacrificing their blood for the nation. \n\nStill, if we play cricket with the Pakistan team and they get the economic benefits, that would be really shameful ( can‚Äôt have a better word).\nWhether it‚Äôs ICC or ACC, they just want to create revenue through India and Pakistan matches.\n\nBut there has not been much protest or anything against this. No cricketing journalists, ex-players, or Twitter warriors would raise a voice against this. I feel this is the high time that we fans come together and protest against this match on different platforms and boycott any cricketing with Pakistan in the near future. \n\nBut these are all my opinions, what do you guys think about this ?
