            "text": "Big news! Elon Musk has announced that his AI company, xAI, is building Grokipedia, an AI-powered online encyclopedia designed to compete with Wikipedia.\n\n**What is Grokipedia?**  \nIts an AI-driven digital encyclopedia that aims to be a more neutral and unbiased alternative to Wikipedia. Musk has criticized Wikipedia in the past for being “too woke” and believes Grokipedia can offer a better knowledge-sharing platform.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n* **AI-Powered Content:** Uses xAI’s AI system “Grok” to curate and verify information.\n* **Community Contributions:** Users can contribute content, with AI helping ensure accuracy and quality.\n* **Beta Launch Soon:** Early beta (v0.1) expected in about two weeks.\n\n**Why Musk is Doing This:**  \nHe is long criticized Wikipedia and has even joked about buying it. Recent concerns over Wikipedia’s editorial practices, including alleged censorship, have pushed Musk to create his own alternative.\n\n**Discussion Points:**\n\n* Will Grokipedia succeed as a neutral alternative to Wikipedia?\n* How will AI and community contributions impact the accuracy of content?\n* Can Musk’s platform gain public trust and traction?\n\nWhat do you think  is Grokipedia the Wikipedia killer, or just another experiment?",

            "text": "Grokipedia, the Wikipedia of Elon Musk, just went live. I just checked it and read articles about TV shows focused on female empowerment (Buffy, Sex and the City, etc.). Essentially, it’s like Wikipedia written by an incel, complaining about the roles of men and gay characters. I had to share it with you, what’s your take on this?\n\nBuffy:  \n\"Despite this, analyses highlight inconsistencies in execution, with Buffy repeatedly depending on male figures for critical rescues, such as Angel's soul-restoring sacrifices in seasons 2 and 3 (e.g., 'Innocence,' February 21, 1998) and the male-dominated Initiative's technological aids in season 4, suggesting empowerment is mediated by patriarchal support structures rather than autonomous female capability. Such patterns indicate that while the series projects female primacy, causal resolutions often revert to male intervention, undermining claims of uncompromised agency.\"\n\n\"Male characters are portrayed as emasculated, fueling backlash, with Xander Harris devolving into jealousy-driven incompetence (e.g., his season 6 demotion to construction work amid relational failures) and Giles transitioning to a paternal figure sidelined by Buffy's autonomy, fostering perceptions of diminished masculinity to elevate female leads. Rupert Giles' arc, from authoritative Watcher to emotionally vulnerable dependent, exemplifies this, where traditional male guardianship yields to female dominance without reciprocal empowerment.\"\n\n\"Queer relationships, notably Willow Rosenberg's arc, introduce additional scrutiny over sexuality representation. Willow's initial romance with boyfriend Oz (seasons 2–3) transitions to her relationship with Tara Maclay (seasons 4–6), after which Willow declares herself \"gay now\" in season 4's \"The Spike Report\" (aired February 13, 2001), effectively erasing her prior heterosexual experiences.^(\\[129\\]) This shift has been critiqued in media analyses as bi-erasure, a pattern where bisexual identities are sidelined in favor of monosexual labels, reinforced by Willow's vampire counterpart in \"Doppelgangland\" (season 3, aired February 24, 1999) showing fluid attractions yet not explored as bisexuality. Fan backlash, evident in retrospective essays and academic examinations of tropes, highlights frustration with this framing, arguing it perpetuates stereotypes of bisexuality as a phase rather than a stable orientation, though empirical data on original 1999–2003 reception shows initial praise for visibility outweighed by later reevaluations.\"\n\nI’ll pass.\n\n[https://grokipedia.com/page/Buffy](https://grokipedia.com/page/Buffy)",

            "text": "**The new AI-powered Wikipedia competitor falsely claims that pornography worsened the AIDS epidemic and that social media may be fueling a rise in transgender people.**\n\nElon Musk’s xAI just launched Grokipedia, an AI-written encyclopedia with about 885,000 articles at version 0.1, compared to Wikipedia’s 7+ million English articles. Musk says Wikipedia is full of “propaganda” and left-wing bias, and he’s pitching Grokipedia as the fix. But reporters quickly found that many Grokipedia pages are copied nearly word-for-word from Wikipedia, with only a small notice saying they were “adapted,” and in other places the AI rewrites things to match Musk’s politics.\n\nWhere Grokipedia doesn’t just copy, it leans hard into right-wing framing. Its entry on U.S. slavery spends time defending pro-slavery ideology and attacks The 1619 Project for saying slavery was central to American politics and economics, which echoes conservative backlash against that project. On LGBTQ topics it’s even more aggressive: searching “gay marriage” doesn’t return “gay marriage” at all, but suggests “gay pornography,” and that article falsely blames porn for worsening the HIV/AIDS crisis in the 1980s by encouraging unsafe sex among gay men.\n\nThe treatment of trans people also mirrors current far-right talking points. The “transgender” article uses language like “transgenderism,” calls trans women “biological males,” and frames trans inclusion mainly as a danger to “women’s safety, privacy, and sex-based protections,” implying that trans people are a threat. It also pushes the idea that social media is acting like a “contagion” that spreads being trans, which is a common narrative in anti-trans activism and not how medical orgs describe gender identity.\n\nGrokipedia constantly attacks mainstream media and elevates Musk and his allies. The entry on WIRED accuses the magazine of becoming “far-left wing propaganda” and claims the media in general has a “systemic leftward lean.” Coverage of Donald Trump complains that CNN and The New York Times are biased against Republicans and excuses the shutdown fight as “bipartisan failures.” Meanwhile, Musk’s own page is enormous (about 11,000 words, vs under 8,000 on Wikipedia) and includes sections praising his fights against “woke culture” and regulation. The site even nudges search suggestions that flatter Musk while highlighting drama around rivals like OpenAI’s Sam Altman.\n\nRead the full Wired article: [https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-launches-grokipedia-wikipedia-competitor/](https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-launches-grokipedia-wikipedia-competitor/)\n\nGrokipedia can be accessed at [https://grokipedia.com](https://grokipedia.com)\n\n**Other outlets:**\n\n* NYTimes (unpaywalled): [www.nytimes.com/2025/10/27/technology/grokipedia-launch-elon-musk.html?unlocked\\_article\\_code=1.w08.9UiO.PznF2qx0FDQo&smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare](http://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/27/technology/grokipedia-launch-elon-musk.html?unlocked_article_code=1.w08.9UiO.PznF2qx0FDQo&smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare)\n* Business Insider: [https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-launches-grokipedia-xai-wikipedia-competitor-2025-10](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-launches-grokipedia-xai-wikipedia-competitor-2025-10)\n* The Verge on Grokipedia copying Wikipedia articles: [https://www.theverge.com/news/807686/elon-musk-grokipedia-launch-wikipedia-xai-copied](https://www.theverge.com/news/807686/elon-musk-grokipedia-launch-wikipedia-xai-copied)",

            "text": "Elon Musk a lancé Grokipedia, une encyclopédie en ligne conçue pour concurrencer Wikipédia, accusée par lui de biais idéologique, particulièrement à gauche. Le lancement de cette plateforme, qui utilise l'intelligence artificielle, a été annoncé le 27 octobre 2025. Grokipedia a démarré avec plus de 885.000 définitions, bien qu'elle soit encore loin des 7 millions de Wikipédia.\n\nMusk déclare que le but de Grokipedia est de fournir “toute la vérité, rien que la vérité” et qu'il est crucial de purger la plateforme de toute forme de propagande. Il critique Wikipédia pour son contrôle par des activistes politiques, affirmant que Grokipedia serait “meilleure que Wikipédia” et plus objective. Cependant, le contenu de Grokipedia reflète parfois des biais, notamment à l'égard de figures controversées comme lui-même et certains mouvements sociaux, ce qui soulève des questions sur la véritable impartialité de cette nouvelle encyclopédie.\n\nDes articles sur Grokipedia montrent déjà une orientation dans leur rédaction. Par exemple, la page consacrée à Elon Musk indique qu'il a \"influencé le débat\" sur divers sujets et parle des manifestations de Black Lives Matter sans préciser qu'elles se sont majoritairement déroulées pacifiquement. Ces choix rédactionnels soulèvent des doutes sur la prétendue neutralité de Grokipedia, malgré son image de plateforme « open source ».\nConclusion\n\nGrokipedia représente une réponse directe aux critiques de Wikipédia par Musk, mais le véritable impact de cette initiative sur le paysage de l’information reste à déterminer, surtout en ce qui concerne son objectivité et ses motivations politiques sous-jacentes. \n\nLien : https://www.ladepeche.fr/2025/10/28/elon-musk-toute-la-verite-rien-que-la-verite-wikipedia-est-trop-a-gauche-pour-le-milliardaire-il-lance-grokipedia-13018937.php",

            "text": "The Factual Basis section of the Grokipedia entry on The Kashmir Files confirms:\n\n•  1990 exodus of 100,000–350,000 Kashmiri Pandits (95% of the Hindu population) was triggered by targeted Islamist militant violence, including 650+ threats and 219 verified killings (1989–1991).\n\n•  Mosque loudspeaker threats like “Raliv, Chaliv ya Galiv” (“Convert, leave, or die”) and “Kafiron Kashmir chhod do” are documented in government logs and survivor accounts.\n\n•  The film draws from 700+ firsthand interviews and RTI data, refuting claims the exodus was state-orchestrated.\n\n•  Militants (JKLF, Hizbul Mujahideen), backed by Pakistan’s ISI, issued fatwas and manifestos explicitly calling for Hindu expulsion to create an Islamic enclave.\n\nCore takeaway: The film’s depiction of a jihadist-driven ethnic purge is factually grounded in primary sources, though it uses composite characters and timeline compression for drama. Left-leaning media outlets and some Muslim commentators dismissed these events as exaggerations or “myths,” downplaying verified killings and threats as part of broader unrest, while ignoring militant manifestos and survivor testimonies.. claims contradicted by official records and independent investigations.\n\nEthnic Cleansing Confirmation: Yes, the events qualify as ethnic cleansing under UN definitions (1994 Framework): deliberate removal of an ethnic/religious group from a territory through violence, terror, and forced displacement to achieve demographic homogeneity. The drastic reduction of Kashmiri Pandits from ~140,000 (1981) to under 3,000 today, via systematic killings, threats, and property destruction, meets this criterion—widely recognized by scholars, human rights bodies, and Indian government reports.",

Create the article in English, following the rules below, and the ones you know. 6.1) When a periodical is cited as a reference with the {{Article}} or {{cite news}} template, replace it with this one: {{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |title= |url= |journal= |volume= |issue= |publisher= |pages= |doi= |access-date=}}. Make sure that the \"|date=\" and \"|access-date=\" parameters are present and filled in, this is essential and mandatory. 6.2) When a scientific article is cited as a reference, modify the cite news template to this one: {{Citation |last= |first= |year= |title= |publisher= |publication-place= |page= |url= |access-date=}}. Make sure that the \"|date=\" and \"|access-date=\" parameters are present and filled in, this is essential and mandatory. 6.3) If it's from a book: \"{{cite book |last= |first= |date= |title= |url= |location= |publisher= |page= |isbn= |access-date=}}\". Make sure that the \"|date=\" and \"|access-date=\" parameters are present and filled in, this is essential and mandatory. 6.4) Use \"{{cite web |last= |first= |date= |title= |url= |website= |location= |publisher= |access-date=}}\" template to cite website. Make sure that the \"|date=\" and \"|access-date=\" parameters are present and filled in, this is essential and mandatory. 6.5) Also use the dates in the templates above, for example: \"|access-date=13 March 2025\" or \"|date=March 2025\" 6.7) Use this kind of template for dates {{Date|8 July 2024}}. When a date appears in a template, you must always respect this coding: \"day Month year\", in English. The first letter of the month must be capitalized. 6.8) Remove the {{Unité}} template and replace it with the number it contains   7) When a page is cited, you must do it like this: {{p.|421–44}} must be transformed into \"pp. 421–44.\" Do not translate the textual content present in the <ref> tags, such as article titles or others. You just have to adapt the template as seen before, not translate its content. Don't forget to translate the target of the links (\\[\\[\\]\\]) into English so that they reach an English Wikipedia page. Replace the \"{{Liste simple\" template with \"{{plainlist\" Replace the \"{{sfn\" templates by filling in this template: {{sfn | <last1\\*> | <last2> | <last3> | <last4> | <year\\*> | p= <page> | loc= <location> }} Try to replace the infobox with a suitable infobox from Wikipedia in English. DO NOT REFORMULATE THE LINKS OR THE TITLES OF THE SOURCES YOU USE. DO NOT USE WIKIPEDIA AS A SOURCE!\n\nMusk's-team could add any prompt for it to be as littly biased as possible, just like that:\n\nFor biographies, the prompt could add:\n\n>Refrain from using biased sources, and never express political judgments or classifications unless the person explicitly claims it openly.\n\nIt could also be collaborative. People could click on a button \"Extand this article\", and then it would use the same prompt, paste the article content, and add:\n\n>this is a user request. If you find any way to extend the article, tell in code where to put the extension of the article, and paste the text's body. Don't overdo it, if there's nothing to add, or if an addition isn't possible according to you, just gently inform the user that the article is pretty complete at the moment.\n\nAnd now you have original not-so AI-slop, ready-to-go. Nowadays Wikipedia's new article are, according to what I see, 95% AI-generated (on some other wikipedias, they enforce it pretty well, but on english wikipedia new articles are almost exclusively \"ai slop\" to start with. You could beat them at this game easily and make shit tons of articles with unlimited tokens and Grok Search, and some computing. Pretty sure in a single day you can make 1 million, original articles that need no other attributions than the references it uses.\n\nSuch a wasted opportunity.\n\nP.S: The irony about Wikipedia is now that articles are AI-slop. The \"Reception\" part of this article, which is oriented towards the fact that Grokipedia is AI generated contains whole segments that ARE AI generated : [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grokipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grokipedia) \\- Such as this one which is the most obvious:\n\n>Grokipedia has received mixed coverage, with some observers questioning its neutrality due to AI's potential to reflect creator biases.\\[19\\]\\[6\\] Critics have highlighted entries that promote far-right perspectives or favor Musk's viewpoints. NBC News noted that the Grokipedia entry for Musk did not mention the hand gesture he made in January 2025, which many viewed as a Nazi salute, while Wikipedia's article does.\n\nI generated enough Wikipedia articles to spot it (CopyLeaks confirms with 100% certitude it's AI generated btw). Making a Grokipedia this way would be actually of same value as what Wikipedia comes with nowadays.",

            "text": "Grok World Just Got Seriously Exciting | And Your Feed Will Never Be The Same 🔥\n\nElon Musk's xAI just dropped a bombshell of updates that'll change how you scroll, search, and chat online. Grokipedia, the AI-powered Wikipedia rival, was supposed to launch on October 20, 2025, but got delayed | Musk pushed it back to \"end of the week\" to \"purge out the propaganda,\" promising a knowledge base that's more accurate and less biased than traditional sources. The beta version (v0.1) aims to use Grok AI to scan massive amounts of content, ask what's true or false, and rewrite it with full context - no hidden agendas, just facts.\n\nX Feed Gets A Brain Transplant\n\nHere's where it gets crazy: X's entire recommendation algorithm is switching to full Grok AI power within 4-6 weeks of the October 18, 2025 announcement. That means Grok will literally read every single post and watch every video | over 100 million pieces of content daily | to match you with stuff you'll actually love. No more boring timelines filled with random viral junk. The system ditches all hand-coded rules (those old \"heuristics\") and lets AI figure out what makes *you* tick.\n\n**Plot twist**: Most users might never notice the change because X lets you set your chronological \"Following\" feed as default, bypassing the algorithmic \"For You\" feed entirely. Unlike Instagram or TikTok that force-feed you algorithm picks, X respects your choice | but that also means the Grok upgrade only helps people who actively use the \"For You\" tab.\n\nGrok 4 Knows What's Happening Right Now\n\nGrok 4 launched earlier in 2025 with real-time search integration\n\n that pulls fresh facts from the web and X posts instantly. Need the latest news, stock prices, or sports scores? Grok 4 grabs it in a flash instead of giving you outdated textbook answers. It also packs multimodal skills | coding help, image understanding, voice features | and handles a massive 2 million token context window for complex questions. The \"Fast\" version cuts costs by 98% while staying super quick (342 tokens per second output speed).\n\nMeet Mika: Your New AI Sidekick\n\nThe numbers don't lie | xAI just launched Mika, the fourth Grok Companion, on October 24-25, 2025. She's an anime-style AI character with blue hair, a star-studded jacket, and a bold personality designed for dynamic, engaging chats. Mika joins other companions like Ani, Valentine, and Rudi, giving users different AI personas to match their vibe. Available to Premium and SuperGrok users (not Android or free tiers yet), she's your go-to buddy for questions, laughs, and those \"who do I ask this?\" moments when you're stuck.\n\nWhat's your take? Will Grokipedia become your new fact-checking champion, or are you sticking with old-school Wikipedia?\n\nSubscribe for more AI innovation stories.\n\nSources:\n- Cybernews (October 21, 2025)\n- Times of India (October 20, 2025)\n- Social Media Today (October 18, 2025)\n- Storyy.co (October 18, 2025)\n- HBLab Group (October 1, 2025)\n- Vavoza (October 25, 2025)\n- Latestly (October 24, 2025)\n- xAI Official (July 8, 2025)\n- Hyscaler (September 28, 2025)\n- Off The Grid XP Substack (September 19, 2025) ",

            "text": "**TLDR**  \nElon Musk has launched *Grokipedia*, an AI-generated encyclopedia built by his company xAI to challenge what he calls Wikipedia’s “propaganda.” With over 800,000 entries already live, Grokipedia reflects Musk’s political views and integrates with his growing media empire. Critics warn it may spread biased or misleading information under the guise of neutrality—raising questions about who controls public knowledge in the AI age.\n\n  \n\n\n**SUMMARY**  \nElon Musk introduced a new online encyclopedia called *Grokipedia*, powered by his AI company xAI. He says the goal is to clean up what he sees as political bias in Wikipedia. The site launched with over 800,000 AI-written entries and positions itself as a free-speech alternative.\n\nSome of the entries reflect Musk’s personal views, especially on topics like gender, politics, and media. For example, Grokipedia downplays the medical evidence supporting gender transition and highlights Musk’s criticisms of former Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal.\n\nThis is part of a larger trend: Musk is building his own digital ecosystem, from X (formerly Twitter) to Grok, his AI chatbot. Supporters say this gives conservatives a voice. Critics say it’s an attempt to control public information and push political narratives through AI.\n\nWikipedia’s leaders responded by defending their focus on accuracy and neutrality, even as they face falling human traffic and increasing AI scraping. The Wikimedia Foundation is working to counter bias, but Musk’s challenge highlights how fast AI is changing how people access and trust knowledge online.\n\n  \n\n\n**KEY POINTS**\n\n* **Grokipedia Launches**: Elon Musk debuts Grokipedia, an AI-generated encyclopedia created by his AI company xAI.\n* **800,000+ Entries**: While Wikipedia has nearly 8 million human-written pages, Grokipedia starts with over 800,000 entries produced by AI.\n* **Bias Concerns**: Many entries reflect Musk’s views, including politically charged topics like gender transition and media coverage.\n* **Media Ecosystem**: Grokipedia joins Musk’s expanding media and AI efforts, including X and the Grok chatbot, forming an alternative information ecosystem.\n* **Wikipedia Clash**: Musk criticizes Wikipedia as biased and “woke,” while Wikipedia defends its neutrality and commitment to source-based accuracy.\n* **AI Impact on Knowledge**: Wikipedia faces a decline in human visits as AI tools pull its data but don’t link back, reducing visibility and funding.\n* **Academic Response**: Researchers warn that controlling knowledge through platforms like Grokipedia could shape public opinion and political power.\n* **Freedom vs. Fact-Checking**: Grokipedia raises tough questions—can AI be trusted to inform the public, or will it simply reflect the biases of its creators?\n\nSource: [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/27/technology/grokipedia-launch-elon-musk.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/27/technology/grokipedia-launch-elon-musk.html)",

[grokipedia.com](https://grokipedia.com/page/GameStop)\n* Grokipedia touts itself as a “next-gen” encyclopedia (version 0.1) built by AI, with about \\~900k entries so far — far fewer than Wikipedia’s \\~7M English articles. [People.com+2Business Insider+2](https://people.com/elon-musk-launches-ai-powered-grokipedia-compete-with-wikipedia-11838303?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n* There are big questions: content origin (some from Wikipedia), editorial transparency, potential ideological bias. [The Guardian+1](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/28/elon-musk-grokipedia?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Discussion points:**\n\n1. How much of the GME article seems credible/useful for our stock-deep dorks vs how much is “just another source”?\n2. Does the fact that Grokipedia is AI-driven change how we should treat alt-information sources on meme-stocks and short interest?\n3. Could this platform become another place for coordinated narratives (positive or negative) around stocks like GME?\n4. Should we ever cite Grokipedia in our DD? Probably not yet — but could it matter if it grows?\n\nCurious what you all think — especially given the wild ride GME has had.",

            "title": "Grokipedia: Vasectomy: Long-Term Risks and Outcomes",
            "text": "**Vasectomy**\n\n**Long-Term Risks and Outcomes**\n\n**Chronic Pain Syndromes**\n\nPost-vasectomy pain syndrome (PVPS) refers to persistent scrotal or testicular pain lasting at least three months following vasectomy, often characterized by intermittent or constant discomfort that may radiate to the groin or lower abdomen. Pain intensity ranges from dull ache to sharp, debilitating episodes, exacerbated by physical activity, ejaculation, or prolonged sitting, and affects 1-2% of vasectomy patients severely enough to impair quality of life according to American Urological Association guidelines. Broader incidences of any post-procedural scrotal pain, including transient cases, reach 15% in systematic reviews, with higher rates (up to 24%) linked to conventional scalpel techniques compared to 7% for no-scalpel methods. These figures derive from prospective audits and meta-analyses aggregating data from thousands of cases, though definitions vary, potentially inflating short-term reports while underestimating chronicity due to loss to follow-up.\n\nEtiological mechanisms remain debated and likely multifactorial, with no single cause identified in peer-reviewed literature. Proposed contributors include epididymal congestion from sperm backlog, leading to distension and inflammation; formation of sperm granulomas causing localized irritation; and iatrogenic nerve entrapment or damage to structures like the genitofemoral or pudendal nerves during vasal occlusion. Autoimmune responses via anti-sperm antibodies or sympathetic nerve-mediated hypersensitivity have also been hypothesized, supported by histopathological findings of perineural fibrosis in affected tissues. Risk factors include preoperative scrotal pain, larger vasal lumens predisposing to incomplete occlusion, and surgical technique, though evidence for prevention via fascial interposition or cautery is inconclusive.\n\nDiagnosis relies on clinical history excluding acute complications like infection or hematoma, supplemented by physical exam, ultrasound to assess for cysts or asymmetry, and occasionally Doppler flow studies. Management prioritizes conservative measures: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for initial relief, tricyclic antidepressants or gabapentinoids for neuropathic components, and pelvic floor physical therapy to address muscular hypertonicity. Refractory cases may involve spermatic cord blocks with anesthetics and steroids, offering temporary relief in 60-80% of trials, or botulinum toxin injections targeting nerve hyperactivity. Surgical interventions, such as microsurgical denervation or vasectomy reversal (vasovasostomy), yield pain resolution in 50-90% of selected patients, particularly those with congestive symptoms, but carry risks of recurrence or failure to restore fertility. Long-term outcomes emphasize multidisciplinary approaches, as uncontrolled pain can lead to psychological distress, though regret rates specific to PVPS remain low relative to overall vasectomy reversals.\n\n**Associations with Systemic Diseases**\n\nNumerous epidemiological studies have investigated potential links between vasectomy and systemic diseases, with most large-scale analyses concluding no substantial causal associations. Observational data from cohort studies spanning decades, including follow-up periods exceeding 20 years, indicate that vasectomy does not elevate overall mortality or risks for major systemic conditions beyond what is observed in unvasectomized populations.\n\nRegarding prostate cancer, evidence remains inconsistent across meta-analyses of prospective studies. A 2017 systematic review of 53 studies reported a weak 5% increased relative risk (RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.09) for incident prostate cancer, primarily driven by low-bias cohort data, though the absolute risk increase was deemed clinically insignificant. Conversely, a 2016 meta-analysis of high-quality studies found no significant association, attributing earlier positive findings to detection bias from increased medical surveillance post-vasectomy. More recent 2021 and 2025 pooled analyses of cohort studies highlighted persistent heterogeneity, with some subgroups showing modest elevations in localized disease risk (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.03-1.25), but no consistent link to advanced or fatal prostate cancer. These discrepancies may stem from confounding factors like socioeconomic status or screening frequency, as vasectomized men often undergo more frequent prostate-specific antigen testing.\n\nFor cardiovascular disease, multiple systematic reviews and long-term cohorts affirm no increased incidence or mortality. A 2017 meta-analysis of observational studies reported no excess risk of cardiovascular events (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95-1.10) or death from such causes, even after 15+ years post-procedure. Similarly, a 1992 New England Journal of Medicine analysis of over 10,000 men followed for up to 21 years found hazard ratios near unity for coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Proposed mechanisms, such as antisperm antibody-induced atherosclerosis, lack empirical support in human data, with animal models failing to replicate clinical outcomes.\n\nAutoimmune diseases show no elevated post-vasectomy risk in large population-based studies. A 2007 analysis of over 140,000 Danish men with up to 10 years of follow-up detected no increase in immune-related conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis (adjusted RR 0.98-1.05 across categories). American Urological Association guidelines, informed by similar epidemiologic evidence, state no causal link, despite transient antisperm autoantibodies in up to 50-70% of cases, which rarely progress to systemic autoimmunity. Regulatory T-cell dynamics post-vasectomy appear sufficient to maintain tolerance, preventing broader dysregulation.\n\nOther systemic outcomes, including dementia, testicular cancer, and hormonal imbalances, exhibit no robust associations in peer-reviewed reviews. Long-term hormone levels (testosterone, PSA) remain unchanged, and overall health metrics align with age-matched controls. These findings underscore vasectomy's safety profile for systemic health, though ongoing surveillance addresses residual uncertainties from observational designs.\n\n*28 Oct 2025*\n\nhttps://grokipedia.com/page/Vasectomy#long-term-risks-and-outcomes",

            "text": "Elon Musk just announced **Grokipedia (v0.1)** — an AI-powered knowledge platform by xAI that aims to rival Wikipedia.\n\nRight now, it’s early (around 885K entries vs. Wikipedia’s 6M+), but Musk says v1.0 will be *“10× better.”*  \nHis idea? A dynamic, reasoning-driven encyclopedia where AI doesn’t just retrieve info — it *understands* it.\n\nThat’s both fascinating and dangerous.  \nIf knowledge itself becomes model-generated, we’ll need new frameworks for **truth, bias control, and content verification**.\n\nThis isn’t just another data project — it’s a test of how far we’re willing to let AI define *what’s real*.\n\n🔍 Discussion points:\n\n* Can an AI encyclopedia ever be truly neutral?\n* Should we trust model-curated knowledge the same way we trust human-edited sources?\n* How should open-source communities respond if Grokipedia scales faster than Wikipedia’s human moderation system?\n\n**Source:** [Business Insider — Grokipedia Launch Report](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-launches-grokipedia-xai-wikipedia-competitor-2025-10?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n\n**Disclaimer:** This post shares publicly verified information about Grokipedia’s launch for educational and discussion purposes.

            "text": "Elon Musk announced Tuesday that his artificial intelligence company xAI is developing \"Grokipedia,\" an AI-powered encyclopedia positioned as a direct challenge to Wikipedia's dominance in online knowledge sharing.\n\n\"We are building Grokipedia u/xAI. Will be a massive improvement over Wikipedia. Frankly, it is a necessary step towards the xAI goal of understanding the Universe,\" Musk wrote on X.\n\nMusk's announcement came in response to criticism from White House crypto czar David Sacks, who called Wikipedia \"hopelessly biased\" and controlled by \"an army of left-wing activists.\" Sacks, who was appointed by President Trump as the nation's first AI and crypto czar in December 2024, argued that Wikipedia's influence extends beyond casual readers to AI model training, creating broader systemic problems.\n\nThe criticism echoes longstanding concerns raised by Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger, who has accused the platform of abandoning its neutrality principles. In recent interviews, Sanger warned that left-wing activists have \"corrupted Wikipedia and seized control of its ability to shape narratives with a toxic leftist tilt.\" Sanger has specifically criticized Wikipedia's coverage of political figures, drug legalization, and other contentious topics as reflecting a clear ideological bias.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the project, Grokipedia will leverage xAI's Grok AI models to automatically detect inaccuracies in online content and rewrite them using \"synthetic corrections.\" The system would draw from Wikipedia, books, and other online sources to create what Musk describes as more objective versions of information, filtering out what he perceives as errors and ideological bias.\n\nThe project represents an evolution of xAI's Grok chatbot beyond simple conversational AI. The company recently released Grok 4 Fast in September 2025, a more efficient reasoning model that reduces token usage by 40% while maintaining performance benchmarks. This latest version features a 2-million token context window and costs significantly less than competitors while ranking first in search-related tasks on evaluation platforms.",

            "text": "There seems to be a recent push here complaining about Wikipedia and this is where it comes from, a conservative coordinates effort to try and discredit Wikipedia.\n\n>For those not chronically online, however, this past week’s tempest over Wikipedia can be jolting—especially given the site’s objective to remain trustworthy. For many, it is the modern-day encyclopedia—a site written and edited by volunteers that aims to offer, as Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales once said, free access to “the sum of all human knowledge.”\n\n>To do that, Wikipedia adheres to three core policies that guide how entries are written. Each article must have a neutral point of view, be verifiable with information coming from published sources and no original research.\nIn effect, those final two points mean information comes summarized from known media sources. Those policies—and how they’re enforced—are what upset opponents such as billionaire Musk, White House AI czar David Sacks and others who don’t like its perceived slant.\n\n>Some call it “Wokepedia.” They talk as if its more than 64 million worldwide entries are fueled by mainstream media lies, pumping out propaganda that feeds online search results. For them, the threat is especially worrisome as Wikipedia is serving as a base layer of knowledge for AI chatbots.\n\nSo basically because the links must come from verifiable, published sources, some people (like Elon Musk) don't like it and have been calling it all sorts of names. Wikipedia is perhaps the best example of what we can do with each other in the post Gutenberg Parenthesis world. It's curated to be neutral by volunteers, through consensus, but anyone can edit it. \n\n>This past week, as the Wikipedia controversy reignited, Musk announced xAI would, in fact, offer up Grokipedia. Soon after, the Wikipedia page for Musk’s Grok was updated. The entry included a brief comparison to an effort almost 20 years earlier to create another Wikipedia alternative called Conservapedia.\n\nOh, there it is.",
